## Typography Terms ##

**Typeface** (also known as a font family): a family of letters and characters that are designed to be presented together to form words and numbers. Arial, Calibri, and Helvetica are examples of typefaces.

**Font:** a specific set of distinct, stylized letters within a typeface, such as:
* Garamond Regular, bold, 12px
* Arial, italic, 6px

Font should not be confused with typeface or font family (see below). Although these terms are often used interchangeably, technically, these are not the same. A font describes the specific size, style, and weight of text, which designers can use. A typeface is the group to which a specific font belongs.

**Font decoration** (also known as text decoration): embellishments to lines of text including overline, underline, and strikethrough text.

**Font effect:** modification which can be made to letters or lines of text in order to increase their prominence.    
Common modifications include bevels, inlines (borderlines inside the boundaries of each letter), outlines (borderlines outside the boundaries of each letter), and shadows. 

**Font style:** the specific variant of a typeface’s appearance (e.g. the “Roman” of the typeface “Times New Roman”).    
Some examples include: case (uppercase, lowercase, small caps) and skew (roman, italic). 

**Serif:** the small hook-like element, which resembles a foot, found on the end of lines in some typefaces.
A serif font is a font in which the letters have serifs on the ends of the lines on each letter.

**Sans-serif:** without serif or any extra elements at the bottom of the letter.
A sans-serif font’s letters do not have serifs.

Before the digital age, serif fonts were deemed more legible, and easier to read than sans-serif ones, but in modern days, sans-serif fonts have comparable and sometimes better legibility, especially on digital screens. (The issue was that the serifs didn’t render nicely on low-resolution screens, but this problem is happily behind us on modern computers and mobile phones.)

These two styles of font also have an impact on the tone of a website. Sans serif fonts can often carry the following connotations: modern, hip, cold, and impersonal; while serif fonts may carry the following connotations: traditional, warm, expensive, and old fashioned. That said, this can vary, depending on the typeface.

**Font weights:** the thickness of the lines in each letter. Some examples include:  thin, ultrathin, light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, extra bold, black, and ultrablack.

**Font width:** the width of each letter, as determined by the widest point of the outermost lines of that letter (not to be confused with font weight, or kerning).    
Examples include: condensed, extra condensed, narrow, extended, ultraextended, and expanded.

**Hanging Indent:** when the first line of text in a paragraph has a leftmost margin that is further to the left than that of the lines in the paragraph that follows. A hanging indent is often used to help make key phrases or terms prominent and can sometimes aid in scanning lists. 

**Letter Spacing** (also known as tracking): the space between the widest points of each character, not to be confused with kerning (see below), which is often applied to the entire word, line, or paragraph.

**Kerning:** the negative horizontal space between consecutive characters, often applied to a specific group of letters. Sometimes, it may be referred to as the “breathing room” between letters. There is usually an automatic or standard spacing associated with each typeface, however, this may be altered to achieve a visually-balanced appearance.

**Leading** (also known as line height or line spacing): the negative vertical space between text lines, measured baseline to baseline. The baseline is the base of each letter not including downstrokes (such as those seen in lowercase ‘p’ and ‘q’).

**Ligature:** two or more letters touching to form a single character; A ligature might be a decorative choice for branding or aesthetics purposes or a cue for linguistics purposes.

**Gadzook:** the decoration or adornment which connects the two letters of a ligature (example: FedEx logo).

**Orphan:** a very short line of text (usually a single word) appearing on its own line after a line break. To avoid orphans, consider inserting a line break, and not a paragraph break (see below) earlier in the sentence so that the word does not “live alone,” on the line so to speak. It is better to have more than two words on the last line, if possible, for a more comfortable, visually balanced appearance.

**Line break:** a point in a block of text which designates the end of one line of text and the beginning of the next line; not to be confused with paragraph break. Line breaks are often found in HTML as the break tag to indicate a “soft” enter/return on the keyboard.

**Paragraph break:** a point in a block of text which designates the end of one paragraph and the beginning of another, often including a larger vertical space between the two paragraphs than what between the lines of text within a paragraph. Paragraph breaks are often written in HTML as the paragraph tag to indicate a “hard” enter/return on the keyboard.
